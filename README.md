# 🧩 DevOps Experiment 8 – Container Orchestration using Docker Compose and Kubernetes

## 📘 Overview
This repository contains the implementation of **Experiment 8** from the DevOps lab, focused on **container orchestration** using both **Docker Compose** and **Kubernetes (Minikube)**.

The experiment demonstrates how to deploy, manage, and scale a **two-tier web application** consisting of:
- **Backend:** Flask (Python)
- **Frontend:** Express.js (Node.js)

---

## 🚀 Objectives
- Understand the concept of container orchestration.  
- Deploy a multi-container application using **Docker Compose**.  
- Deploy the same application using **Kubernetes**.  
- Compare orchestration features such as **scaling**, **service discovery**, and **fault tolerance**.

---

## ⚙️ Technologies Used
- **Docker**
- **Docker Compose**
- **Kubernetes (Minikube)**
- **Flask (Python Backend)**
- **Express.js (Node.js Frontend)**

---

## ⚡ Steps Performed
1. **Built Docker images** for Flask and Express apps.  
2. **Deployed and verified** multi-container setup using Docker Compose.  
3. **Pushed images to Docker Hub.**  
4. **Deployed the same application** on Kubernetes using Minikube.  
5. **Scaled frontend pods** and **tested self-healing** by deleting pods.  
6. Compared orchestration features between **Docker Compose** and **Kubernetes**.
